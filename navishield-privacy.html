  <h1>NaviShield Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    NaviShield is a lightweight anti-phishing tool designed to check websites for potential malicious content. This policy explains how we handle your data.
  </p>
  
  <h2>1. Data Collection & Storage</h2>
  <p>
    NaviShield does not store or log any personal data, URLs, or browsing history. 
    When you check a link, it is processed in real-time to evaluate site safety, but 
    no record of the link is kept by us.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Since we do not store or log URLs, we have no data to share or sell. 
    NaviShield checks each URL against third-party APIs (e.g., Safe Browsing, AI-based phishing checks), 
    but those requests are ephemeral and are not recorded by NaviShield.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    NaviShield uses services like Google Safe Browsing, WHOIS lookups, or other 
    machine-learning endpoints to assess site risk. These services may have their own 
    privacy policies governing how they handle request data, which is outside NaviShieldâ€™s control.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. 
    By continuing to use NaviShield, you agree to the revised policy.
  </p>
